#Thoughts
For me, the article basically solidified everything that was taught today in class. I also am appreciating learning ES6 first, rather than having to learn a new way to do something that I was already doing. I still need to actually practice getting the terminology of all the concepts together, but I do understand that class inheritance is the old way of doing things, and I also understand the problems that could be caused by using the class method, versus the prototypical method.
